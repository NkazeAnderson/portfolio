            My journey as web developer started back in 2018 when i reunited
            with a friend who just completed his bachelors degree in computer
            sciences. He spent his time reading and coding and I was like wow,
            thatâ€™s amazing. Ever since then I had a hook on it. I eventually
            joined him to write my first HELLO World in HTML :-). It was not
            long till I started writing in JavaScript that I got to realize how
            demanding the field is and as most junior developers do, I diverted
            to WordPress. After a while I got realize the power in JavaScript
            and Python that I embanked in building my skills and today I have
            built and participated in several real world applications. I now
            focus on the React ecosystem for both mobile and web development.
            For back-end development I enjoy using ExpressJS, FastApi and
            Django. I am a cloud developer developing solutions on Amazon Web
            Services - AWS
